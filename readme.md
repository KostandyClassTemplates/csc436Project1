# CSC 436 - Project 1: Interactive Personal Profile

## Project Outline

**Project Name:** Interactive Personal Profile  
**Due Date:** End of Week 4 (Refer to Course Schedule for exact date)  
**Submission Method:** Deploy to Netlify (or similar static site host) and submit the live URL. Also, provide a link to your GitHub repository. (Submissions done on Brightspace)

## Description

Build a single-page interactive personal profile or online resume using advanced HTML, modern CSS, and dynamic JavaScript (no frameworks). The site should be visually appealing, responsive, and engaging, showcasing your skills, interests, and experiences.

## Requirements

### Semantic HTML5 Structure
- Use semantic tags: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc.
- Ensure accessibility (alt attributes, heading hierarchy).

### Modern CSS Styling & Responsiveness
- Clean, visually appealing design.
- Use Flexbox and/or CSS Grid for layout.
- Fully responsive (desktop, tablet, mobile) via media queries.
- Include CSS transitions, animations, or transforms (e.g., hover effects, loading animations).

### Dynamic JavaScript Interactivity
- At least two interactive features using vanilla JS (no frameworks). Examples:
  - Animated skill progress bar on scroll
  - Custom image carousel/slider
  - Dark mode toggle
  - Form with client-side validation
  - Dynamic filter/sort for projects/experiences
- Use modern ES6+ syntax.

### Content
- Sections: About Me, Skills, Experience/Education, Projects, Contact Information
- Use realistic or placeholder content.

### Git & GitHub
- Initialize a Git repository.
- Make regular, meaningful commits.
- Push code to a public GitHub repository.

### Deployment
- Deploy to Netlify (or similar).
- Live URL must be functional and accessible.

## Project Goals (Learning Outcomes)
- Structure web content with semantic HTML5.
- Implement responsive, visually appealing designs with modern CSS.
- Develop dynamic UI elements with vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).
- Use Git for version control and manage a GitHub repo.
- Deploy a static website to a hosting service.
